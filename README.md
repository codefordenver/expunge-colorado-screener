## Project Background 📋

[Expunge Colorado](https://expungecolorado.org/) is a non-profit that provides support for record sealing and expungement. Prior to this new project with Code for Denver, Expunge Colorado was using a Google Form to intake potential candidates for their resourcing. The screener project was created as a way to help Expunge Colorado manage the volume of ineligible support requests that fell outside the scope of their work. Through a series of questions, the screener tool will help determine basic ineligibility criteria for an interested party and intake additional data for those that may be eligible for the services that Expunge Colorado can provide.
